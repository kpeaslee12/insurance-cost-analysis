# 💼 Insurance Charges Data Analysis

This project explores a real-world healthcare dataset to analyze how age, BMI, smoking status, and other factors affect individual medical insurance charges.

## 📚 Dataset
- Source: [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- Rows: 1,338
- Features: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges

## 🎯 Goals
- Visualize key relationships (scatter, line, facet grids)
- Explore how variables like BMI and smoking impact costs
- Build a simple linear regression model to predict insurance charges
- Communicate data insights clearly

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
- FacetGrid and line plot grids
- Correlation heatmaps
- Linear regression modeling with scikit-learn

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Smokers** are charged significantly more than non-smokers
- Higher **BMI** correlates with increased medical costs
- **Age** and **number of children** also influence charges
- Regression model achieved an R² score of ~0.76

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using Seaborn's `FacetGrid` and `relplot` for category-based plotting
- Creating interactive visuals with Plotly
- Encoding categorical variables for regression
- Presenting data storytelling in a structured notebook
